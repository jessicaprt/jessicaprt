                    <p><em>My first hackathon experience!</em></p>
                    <p>Fire Escape is an arcade game that aims to educate players with fire hazards and safety. Four other competitors including myself created this project as part of an entry to <strong>hackEd 2016: </strong><em>U of A Computer Engineering Club's 24-hour hackathon.</em> My part for this project is being in charge of the game's assets-- this includes most of the graphics used in the game, building the maps for the levels, and choosing the sound effects.</p>

                    <p>This was my final project as part of my course in <strong>CMPUT 274 - Introduction to Tangible Computing</strong>.</p>
                    <p>For the hardware components of this version of the classic snake game, a joystick and an LCD (Adafruit) was connected to an Arduino Mega. This game was written in C with the use of the Arduino library.</p>

                    <p>I count this as one of my projects since this was my first time building a website <em>entirely from scratch</em>. I built this shortly after learning HTML and CSS, as well as the jQuery library and the bootstrap framework.</p>
                    <p>With my love for designing, I used what knowledge I have into building a website and played around with it to make it look the way it does. I expect this website to change its looks quite often as I discover more about web development.</p>
