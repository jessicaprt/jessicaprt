                    <p>For my final project in <strong>CMPUT 275 - Introduction to Tangible Computing II</strong>, my partner and I decided to build a one-player Tic Tac Toe game.</p>
                    <p>This impossible game of tic tac toe was implemented by using the minimax algorithm (written in Python) in order to build an AI such that the computer will always win, or the game results in a draw.</p>

                        <p><a href="http://devpost.com/software/fire-escape"> <img src = "images/projects/devpost.png"></a></p>
                    <p><em>My first hackathon experience!</em> Fire Escape is an arcade game that aims to educate players with fire hazards and safety. Four other competitors including myself created this project as part of an entry to <strong>hackEd 2016: </strong><em>U of A Computer Engineering Club's 24-hour hackathon.</em> My part for this project is being in charge of the game's assets-- this includes most of the graphics used in the game, building the maps for the levels, and choosing the sound effects.</p>

                    <p>This was my final project as part of my course in <strong>CMPUT 274 - Introduction to Tangible Computing I</strong>.</p>
                    <p>For the hardware components of this version of the classic snake game, a joystick and an LCD (Adafruit) was connected to an Arduino Mega. This game was written in C with the use of the Arduino library.</p>

                    <p>I count this as one of my projects since this was my first time building a website <em>entirely from scratch</em>. I built this shortly after learning HTML and CSS, as well as the jQuery library and the bootstrap framework.</p>
                    <p>With my love for designing, I used what knowledge I have into building a website and played around with it to make it look the way it does. I expect this website to change its looks quite often as I discover more about web development.</p>
