                <p>Hello! My name is Jessica Prieto. I am a Computer Engineering undergraduate at the University of Alberta.</p>
                <p>I enjoy my time learning more about computer engineering through my academics, as well as teaching myself different development tools and by being around people with a similar passion. I have met a lot of people with the same interests in technology by being involved with the Computer Engineering Club where I currently serve as the VP Social-- I organize academic and social events by the club and I take part in networking with other companies to get them involved.</p>
                <p>I regularly engage in different activities in university. Aside from my involvement with the Computer Engineering club, I also have coordinator positions with the Engineering Students’ Society at the U of A. I have worked as the memories coordinator, where I document all ESS events, and I also worked as the Pi throw coordinator where I organized "Pi Week 2016" - an annal ESS fundraising event that raises money towards Habitat for Humanity.</p>
