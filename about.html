                <h3><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></h3>
                <h4><em>Greetings from planet earth!</em></h4>
                <p>My name is Jessica Antonette Prieto, most commonly known simply as <em>Jessica</em> here on this beautiful planet; born in one of the 7,107 islands of the Philippines, in the nation's capital-<em>Manila</em>. As of 2012, I am currently residing in Calgary, Alberta here in <em>Canada</em>, though for the most part of the year, I live in Edmonton where I am doing my undergraduate studies.</p>
                <p>I am a Computer Engineering student at the University of Alberta, and I am now on my third year of studying. So far it has been the best! What makes it amazing as it is, would undoubtedly be my active involvement with different student groups within the Faculty of Engineering. For the upcoming academic year 2015-2016, I will serve as the <em>memories coordinator</em> for the Engineering Students' Society (my position since the previous year) as well as the <em>pi throw coordinator</em>. A more important position that I am really stoked about, is being the current <em>VP Social</em> for the Computer Engineering Club.</p>
