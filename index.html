                <p>Hello! My name is Jessica Prieto. I am a Computer Engineering undergraduate at the University of Alberta.</p>
                <p>I enjoy my time learning more about computer engineering through my academics, as well as teaching myself different development tools and by being around people with a similar passion. I have met a lot of people with the same interests in technology by being involved with the Computer Engineering Club where I currently serve as the VP Social-- I organize academic and social events by the club and I take part in networking with other companies to get them involved.</p>
                <p>I regularly engage in different activities in university. Aside from my involvement with the Computer Engineering club, I also have coordinator positions with the Engineering Students' Society at the U of A. I have worked as the memories coordinator, where I document all ESS events, and I also worked as the Pi throw coordinator where I organized "Pi Week 2016" - an annal ESS fundraising event that raises money towards Habitat for Humanity.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This impossible game of tic tac toe was implemented by using the minimax algorithm (written in Python) in order to build an AI such that the computer will always win, or the game results in a draw.</p>

           <p>For the hardware components of this version of the classic snake game, a joystick and an LCD (Adafruit) was connected to an Arduino Mega. This game was written in C with the use of the Arduino library.</p>

        <p><i>I finally went to Vancouver for the first time.</i></p>
        <p>Because it was Fall reading break in university, my friend/roommate <b>Liza</b> and I thought that it would be a good idea to leave Edmonton for a bit. We decided to go to Vancouver since we both have never been to the city, and it's fairly close since it's in the neighboring province...
